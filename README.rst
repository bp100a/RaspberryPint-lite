RaspberryPint-lite
=========================

Overview
--------

Based on the RaspberryPint tap management software, I basically
copied the style and images to create a Javascript only
implementation.
For just a tap list didn't need a database and all the
administrative overhead. Added some data for BJCP styles and SRM colors,
but basically edit beerlist.js and you are good to go.
